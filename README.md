# Doordash_delivery_duration_prediction

This dataset is available at StrataScratch. The file historical_data.csv contains a subset of deliveries received at DoorDash in early 2015 in a subset of the cities. Each row in this file corresponds to one unique delivery. Noise is added to the dataset to obfuscate certain business details. Each column corresponds to a feature as explained below. Note all money (dollar) values given in the data are in cents and all time duration values given are in seconds

The target value to predict here is the total seconds value between created_at and actual_delivery_time.
