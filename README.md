# Doordash_delivery_duration_prediction

This dataset is available at StrataScratch. The file historical_data.csv contains a subset of deliveries received at DoorDash in early 2015 in a subset of the cities. Each row in this file corresponds to one unique delivery. Noise is added to the dataset to obfuscate certain business details. Each column corresponds to a feature as explained below. Note all money (dollar) values given in the data are in cents and all time duration values given are in seconds

For a given delivery you must predict the total delivery duration seconds , i.e., the time taken from

Start: the time consumer submits the order (created_at) to
End: when the order will be delivered to the consumer (actual_delivery_time)
